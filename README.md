# CSharp-Console-Game

I decided that it would be a fun challenge to use my limited c# knowledge to create a simple game in the console

At the current stage, I haven't decided what the game would be about, but im thinking about a pokemon like rpg game with different items and enemies

Other than a very basic calculator usless scripts that print data to the console, This is my first real c# project and I think it will be very fun
